**Volleyball Ratings App**

Organize and conduct a rating session with this app so your Raters can stay focused on assessing the skill of the Players they are rating. 

This app tracks three different categories: Admin, Raters, and Players.

    * Admin set up and organize sessions, 1 session at a time, inviting several Raters to join in each session, adding Players that will have their skills rated into each session, and then receiving the averaged scores back in a CSV file. 

    * Players are added by Admin. They are represented by their Player # (their Bib #). Each Player will receive an aggregated rating in the following 5 skills: Serving, Passing/Setting, Defense, Attacking, and Blocking, and an overall rating score will be calculated.

    * Raters - after they have been invited by Admin - will receive an email directing them to the ratings session where they can start rating Players. Raters may rate All Players, or only Odd or Even-numbered Players. Whichever they select, Raters must rate their Players in each of the 5 skills in order to submit their ratings. They can also keep notes on each Player by pressing on the notepad next to each Player's number.
